            <p class="text-center">Are you planning a day trip to Johor Bahru or a quick getaway further up north?
                Fortunately, Singapore is located close to some of the best attractions in Southeast Asia, including the
                island attractions at Tioman Island, Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Christchurch in Malacca, and many
                more! On top of that, our neighbours are known for their cheap and good food—we can all agree with that!
            </p><br>
            <p class="text-center">It’s easy to enjoy all these amazing experiences because Malaysia is a short distance
                away from Singapore. Taking a weekend trip to Johor Bahru is simpler than ever; in fact, most
                destinations can be reached within less than a day when using land transport. Though it is possible to
                drive there yourself, those in the know will tell you that it is so much better to leave the driving to
                someone else. Lean back and relax in a private car from Singapore to Malaysia so you don’t have to worry
                about traffic or getting lost in foreign land.</p><br>
            <p class="text-center">Taking private transport from Singapore to Malaysia is the ideal way to tour the
                cities of Malaysia. Our limo service from Singapore to Malaysia includes airport transfer from Changi
                Airport and private transport to JB (Johor Bahru), Mersing, Desaru, Genting Highlands, and Port Dickson.
                With our private taxi from Singapore to Malaysia, you can get to your destination in the fastest and
                most comfortable way possible. Whether you are a family with young children on the way to Legoland or
                travelling as a group of friends on a day trip to Johor Bahru (JB), our taxi to Malaysia from Singapore
                promises to give you the best value for your money.</p><br>
            <p class="text-center">What are you waiting for? Hop on our private taxi from Singapore to Malaysia for a
                comfortable and convenient journey—you don’t even need to go to Ban San Queen Street to take a street

                up from home.</p><br>
